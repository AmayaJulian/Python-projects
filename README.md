# Python Projects

In this repository I will be posting some of my work in Python. All programs were written using Jupyter Notebooks. The main topics of this projets are:
- Artificial Intelligence: machine learning, deep neural networks, natural language processing, sentiment analysis. 
- Finance: stock markets, cryptocurrencies, algorithmic trading.
- Econophysics: modeling of financial markets.

I am constantly studying new topics, making modifications to old projects and planning new ones. So probably all of this projects will continue evolving, adding more explanations and examples.
